She is stuck and needs help understanding how to use short-circuiting in Python to check for both conditions. Sarah is a software developer working on a program that analyzes text data. As part of her program, she needs to check if a given string contains both the letters \"a\" and \"b\". She has written a function to do this, but it is not working as expected. She knows that she needs to use a conditional statement to check for both conditions, but she is not sure how to do it. \n",
